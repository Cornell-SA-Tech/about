#Cornell SA Tech

##Our Story

Cornell SA Tech (Cornell Student Assembly Technology Committee - phew!) started as an initiative to bring technology to the Undergraduate Student Assembly here at Cornell. What the Student Assembly basically does is create resolutions that go up to assembly vote and that passes on to the current President of Cornell. They are responsible for representing the student voice at Cornell and for advocating for student's concerns. Every year, seats are replaced in a spring election, with special elections if some seats weren't filled and freshmen elections happening in the fall.

Furthermore, SA is responsible for allocating the student activity fee (the $200+ you see in your bursar bill every year) to *all* the organizations on campus. This is done through SAFC. The various committees on the Student Assembly used to be only for elected Student Assembly members. But in 2015, they decided to open it so any student could apply to be a part of one. The Technology committee was created in Fall 2015 for the purpose of creating technology that benefits Cornell students.

Then in Fall 2016, the committee was restructed to what it is now. Each team is comprised of a Project Manager, Front-End Developer, Back-End Developer and a Designer. Teams meet weekly to work on their projects.
